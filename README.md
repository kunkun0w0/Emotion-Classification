# Emotion-Classification

This repo is the final project of *Introduction to Nerual Networks*, an online project-based study instructed from Harvard University by Prof. Pavlos Protopapas.

In this project we:

- validated the performance of various CNNs with different setting when testing on [FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data), a popular emotion classification dataset in Kaggle. 
- used Saliency Map and GradCAM to interpret how networks work.
- produced a real-time facial expression recognition demo with tensorflow2.0 and opencv. 
- applied ensemble learning to attain a better performance on the benchmark dataset.


> The project is implemented by the tensorflow2.0 and the notebook link is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ViI_5V9cAWhCJ_nWR9CQMPvkXw8yaInF?usp=sharing). Feel free to run.
